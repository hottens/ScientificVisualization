Scientific Visualization fluid / smoke simulation
by Sanne Eggengoor and Hayo Ottens

Our simulation is written in the scripting language Python 3.
This means it can be run on all major operating systems.
We did not succeed though, in making an executable and we are very sorry for that.

To run the simulation, first use Pip to install the following libraries:

  enum
  math
  numpy
  Pillow
  PyOpenGL
  queue
  random
  scipy
  socket
  sys
  threading
  time
  tkinter
  
Then, on Windows, in a command window or PowerShell, type "python ./fluid.py".
For Linux and Mac, run by typing "python3 ./fluid.py" in a terminal.
